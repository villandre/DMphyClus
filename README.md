# DMphyClus
A R package for phylogenetic clustering

To install DMphyClus, simply download the folder, start a terminal session and run "R CMD build DMphyClus --no-build-vignettes". This will create DMphyClus_1.0.tar.gz. Then, simply run "R CMD INSTALL DMphyClus".

I strongly suggest reading the vignette before starting to use the package.

Note that you will need to have the OpenMP libraries for the package to compile properly.
