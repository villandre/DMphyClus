# DMphyClus
A R package for phylogenetic clustering

To install DMphyClus, simply download DMphyClus_1.0.tar.gz and run "R CMD INSTALL DMphyClus_1.0.tar.gz".

I strongly suggest reading the vignette before starting to use the package. To do so, start an R session and type "vignette("DMphyClus_Example", package = "DMphyClus")". This should open a browser window and display it. Else, you can simply go to the directory where the package vignette file is found, e.g. ~/R/i686-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/DMphyClus/doc/DMphyClusExample, and open DMphyClus_Example.html directly.

Note that you will need to have the OpenMP libraries for the package to compile properly.
