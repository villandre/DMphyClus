# DMphyClus
A R package for phylogenetic clustering

To install DMphyClus, simply download DMphyClus_1.0.tar.gz and run "R CMD INSTALL DMphyClus_1.0.tar.gz".

I strongly suggest reading the vignette before starting to use the package. To do so, start an R session and type "vignette("DMphyClus_Example", package = "DMphyClus")". This should open a browser window and display it. Else, you can simply go to the directory where the package vignette file is found, e.g. ~/R/i686-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/DMphyClus/doc/DMphyClusExample, and open DMphyClus_Example.html directly. Be aware that running the example in the vignette can take several minutes!

Note that you will need to have the OpenMP libraries available for the package to compile properly.
