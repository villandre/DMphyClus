\title{Within-cluster transition probability matrices}
\format{A list of length 10. Each list element is itself a list, but with
length 3, corresponding to the number of rate variation categories. Each
element of the nested list is a 4x4 matrix giving transition probabilities
between the different nucleotide states.}

\description{
These matrices are meant to be used in the vignette example.
They were obtained with \code{outputTransMatList}.They represent
transition probabilities along branches in the within-cluster phylogenies.
Among-sites rate variation follows a discrete gamma distribution
with 3 categories, and with parameter 0.7589 (Posada et al. 2001).
We assumed that branch lengths follow the exponential distribution
with means between 0.0005 and 0.0015 (10 equally spaced mean assumptions).
